    question: "Does app-based learning mean less social interaction?",
    answer: "Not at all! While students spend 2 hours on apps in the morning, the rest of their day is spent in engaging with their peers and getting direction from the guides via an array of lively activities. In fact, because they donâ€™t have to spend 6 hours looking in the same direction at a chalkboard, Alpha students get more socialization than the average school student."
